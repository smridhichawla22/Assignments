1.Why Java is platform independent?
  Java is platform independent because it uses the concept of generating the byte code of the high level program and then run that 
  byte code on JVM.

2.What are the differences between Heap and stack memory?
  Heap- used for dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated at the run time, complex to keep the track of heap.(for objects)

  Stack- used for static memory allocation, memory is allocated at the compile time, really simple to keep the track of stack.(for variables)

3.Explain public static void main(String [] args)

4.Predict the output of following program
  int main()
  {
	int i;
	int arr[5] = {1};
	for(i=0; i<5; i++)
	{
		printf("%d", arr[i]);
	}
	return 0;
  }
a) 1 followed by four garbage values
 
5.Predict output of the following program
  int main()
  {
	int a[][]= {{1,2},{3,4}};
	int i,j;
	for(i=0;j<2; j++){
		printf("%d", a[i][j]);
	}
	return 0;
  }
  b)Compile error in line "int a[][] = {{1,2},{3,4}}"
  
6.We change the size of an array at run time?
  NO, in an array declaration the size of an array must be known at compile time.
